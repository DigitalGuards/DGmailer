git clone https://github.com/digitalguards/dgmailer.git
cd dgmailer
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv mailer
source mailer/bin/activate  # On Windows: mailer\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python dgmailer.py
```

## Usage

### Setting Up SMTP Servers

1. Click "Add SMTP Server" in the main tab
2. Enter your SMTP server details:
   - Server address
   - Port
   - Username
   - Password
   - TLS mode
3. Test the connection using the "Test" button

### Configuring Email Settings

1. Fill in the email details:
   - Sender address
   - Sender name (optional)
   - Reply-to address (optional)
   - CC/BCC recipients (optional)
2. Enter your email subject and body
3. Choose between HTML or plain text format
4. Add attachments if needed

### Managing Recipients

1. Navigate to the "Email List" tab
2. Either:
   - Enter email addresses manually (one per line)
   - Click "Load from File" to import from TXT/CSV/Excel
3. Use "Validate Emails" to check the format of addresses

### Configuring SMTP Rotation

1. Add multiple SMTP servers through the UI
2. Set "Emails per SMTP" value in the control panel
3. The system will automatically:
   - Rotate servers based on the email limit
   - Monitor server health and errors
   - Apply cooldown periods when needed
   - Select the best performing servers

### Optional Proxy Configuration

While not required for standard email operations (as SMTP servers handle the actual email sending), proxies can be used if additional connection privacy is needed:

1. Go to the "Proxy Settings" tab
2. Enable "Use Proxies"
3. Enter proxy servers (one per line) in host:port format

Note: Proxies only affect the connection between your client and the SMTP server. They do not impact the actual email delivery or the IP address that recipients see (which will be your SMTP server's IP).

### Delivery Controls

1. Click "Delivery Options" to configure:
   - Sending frequency
   - Daily limits
   - Hourly limits
2. Set emails per SMTP server in the main control panel

### Starting the Campaign

1. Review all settings
2. Click "Start" to begin sending
3. Use Pause/Resume/Stop controls as needed
4. Monitor progress in the status bar and log tab

### Monitoring

The system provides detailed monitoring through:
1. Real-time status updates
2. Progress bar showing overall completion
3. Detailed logs showing:
   - Email delivery status
   - SMTP server rotations
   - Error messages
   - Performance metrics

## Best Practices for Email Deliverability

To maintain high deliverability rates:

1. **SMTP Server Configuration**:
   - Use reputable SMTP providers
   - Configure proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Monitor server reputation

2. **Email Content**:
   - Use proper HTML formatting
   - Include text alternatives
   - Follow anti-spam guidelines

3. **Sending Patterns**:
   - Use appropriate rate limits
   - Implement gradual sending increases
   - Monitor bounce rates

4. **List Management**:
   - Keep lists clean and updated
   - Remove bounced addresses
   - Honor unsubscribe requests
